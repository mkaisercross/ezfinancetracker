== todo ==
- add custom plugins to phonegap developer app. can develop ezfinancetracker with app changes pushed over wifi.
- have user enter business' industry. then first search receipt document layouts in database with the same industry
- emailed receipt automatically retrieved from email and stored. dedicated email or personal email option.

- classify fields for receipt with arbitrary document layout. 
    - fuzzy clustering
    - piecewise regression
    - nlp 
    - linear regression in polar coordinates
    - exploratory data analysis
    - pattern recognition
    - histogram analysis
    - 
- use machine learning to improve receipt field classification





== receipt capture process ==
- screen divided vertically. thin pane on left and receipt image on right. left pane contains rows aligned with lines of the receipt.
  - go through steps sequentially. new page dedicated to each
    - 1) select receipt global info. store name, purchase total payed, tax, date of purchase, etc.

    - 3) annotate item details. name, single price, lump sum price, unique id, discount, quantity, 
    - 4) review all receipt annotations and confirm



== menu design ==
- make menu toggle button more visually appealling. better animation, possibly circle shaped. compound shapes.

== visualizations needed. graphs/charts/tables. 

=== layout and design ===
- final layout. tabs for "bar graph", 
- carousel for switching graphs
- custom graphical icon for each graph. to make locating graph in a list easy.
- carousel that shows only current item and a list of dots below showing approximately what position you are in the list. requires spacial memory only from user.
- possible layout. instead of carousel animation between graphs; virtual flyover and vertical land on what looks like logical groups of graphs.


=== chart types ===
- pie chart. money spent by category
- table. items where min_time < purchase date < max_time
- bar graph. 
    - total spent in categories in time period
    - total spent in stores in time period
    - total spent on items in time period
- special graphs.
    - time vs stacked receipt. time on x axis. on y axis a series of vertically stacked bars. showing each item in a receipt.
- table. receipts in chronological order.
- line graph. amount spent vs time.
- monthly calendar. shows total spent each day. 


== functional reqs ==
- initial login screen
- review and modification of OCR results
- schedule recurring purchase/deposit
- manually enter purchase/deposit
- search for items by date, price, store, and category. Results displayed in a list.
- backup of data.
- icons for graphs are screen captures of the latest loading of the graph. 
- clicking on items in graphs allows more details
- category
- tags
- integration with other expense tracking services. 
- integration with google apps
- integration with 

== nonfunctional requirements ==
- available on ios, android, windows phone
- The user data must be available without internet connection.
- The OCR results must detect 50% of the fields accurately in order to be considered a useful feature.



== Debugging Tips ==
- phonegap android app
- chrome desktop. inspect android webviews by browsing to chrome://inspect/#devices in desktop chrome while android phone connected via usb
